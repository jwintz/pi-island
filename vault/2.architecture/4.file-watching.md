Pi Island uses FSEvents for real-time session monitoring.

## Why FSEvents?

| Approach | Latency | CPU Usage |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Polling | 1-5 seconds | High |
| FSEvents | ~100ms | Very Low |

## Event Detection

- `kFSEventStreamEventFlagItemCreated` - New session
- `kFSEventStreamEventFlagItemModified` - Content changed
- `kFSEventStreamEventFlagItemRemoved` - Deleted

## Live Session Handling

Updates are skipped when session is actively processing to prevent feedback loops.
